/**
 * S5 real-world · replay the incident twice (needs OPENROUTER_API_KEY).
 *
 * Same alert, same logs, two investigators. The naive one sends every log line
 * it can find and asks once. The guarded one searches first, caps what reaches
 * the prompt, holds a deadline and a spend ceiling, and refuses to name a cause
 * it cannot cite.
 *
 * Then it kills the log backend and runs the guarded one again, because during a
 * real incident that is the interesting case: the dependency you need in order
 * to investigate is the one that is having the incident.
 *
 * Run it:       npm run lab modules/03-cost-latency-reliability/01-s05-cost-latency-reliability/real-world/index.ts
 * Guarded only: npm run lab modules/03-cost-latency-reliability/01-s05-cost-latency-reliability/real-world/index.ts --guarded
