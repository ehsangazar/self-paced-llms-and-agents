/**
 * LAB 1 — the runnable demo (STARTER).
 *
 * This is the router from `router.ts` wired to a real model and fed a small
 * sample of traffic. The tests prove the logic; this shows you the bill.
 *
 * Run it:  npm run lab modules/01-workflows-and-agents/lab-workflow-router/starter/index.ts
 *
 * Needs OPENROUTER_API_KEY in .env. The tests do not — that is the point of the
 * seam. Get `npm test` green first, then come here.
