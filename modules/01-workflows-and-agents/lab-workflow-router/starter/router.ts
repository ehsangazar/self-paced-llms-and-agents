/**
 * LAB 1 — Workflow router (STARTER).
 *
 * Fill in the TODOs. `modules/01-workflows-and-agents/lab-workflow-router/router.test.ts` is the spec:
 * run `npm test` and make it green.
 *
 * The shape to keep in your head (S1's routing pattern, hardened):
 *
 *     request -> classify -> choose a tier -> handle -> validate -> reply
 *                                    |            |
 *                                    |            +-- on failure: escalate
 *                                    +-- rules / small model / large model
 *
 * Everything the model touches is injected via `RouterDeps`. That is not
 * ceremony: it is what lets the tests run with no API key and no network, and
 * it is the same seam that makes the router swappable in production.
