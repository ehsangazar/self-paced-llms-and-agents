/**
 * SAME TASK, AS AN AGENT.
 *
 * Identical goal: read the email, look up the plan, draft a reply. But now WE
 * don't write the control flow — the model does. It runs in a loop, choosing a
 * tool each turn until it decides it's finished.
 *
 * Watch the call count. The agent re-derives, at runtime and at token cost, the
 * control flow the workflow got for free. Sometimes it takes 3 turns, sometimes
 * 6, occasionally it loops. THAT unpredictability is why the rule is: reach for
 * a workflow first, and only pay for an agent when the task genuinely needs to
 * decide its own steps.
 *
 * Run it:  npm run lab modules/01-workflows-and-agents/s02-code-model-boundary/workflow-vs-agent/as-agent.ts
