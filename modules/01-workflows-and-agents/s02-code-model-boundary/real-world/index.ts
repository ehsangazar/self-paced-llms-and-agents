/**
 * S2 real-world example, the runnable demo (needs OPENROUTER_API_KEY).
 *
 * The intake workflow wired to a real model. Watch the call count: it is two,
 * every run, because you decided the steps. The agent version of the same job
 * (workflow-vs-agent/as-agent.ts) re-derives that control flow at runtime and
 * pays a variable number of calls for it.
 *
 * Run it:  npm run lab modules/01-workflows-and-agents/s02-code-model-boundary/real-world/index.ts
