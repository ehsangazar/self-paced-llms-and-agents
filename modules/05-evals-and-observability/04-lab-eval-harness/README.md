# Lab 5 · Build an Eval Harness

**Module 5 · Evals and Observability**

A golden set, a runner, rule + LLM-judge graders, a trajectory check, and a
pass-rate report that catches a regression you deliberately introduce.

## What you build
- A golden set of eval cases (input + expectations), including a safety/injection case
- A runner that executes each case against your system
- Two grader types: rule-based checks and an LLM-as-judge
- A trajectory check (did it call the right tools, in order?)
- A pass-rate report that fails when you plant a regression

## Where to start
The generate → grade → refine loop this builds on is demonstrated in
[`week-1 · s1 · patterns/05-evaluator-optimizer.ts`](../../01-workflows-and-agents/01-s01-why-demos-die/patterns/05-evaluator-optimizer.ts).
Shared LLM client: [`../../../common/llm.ts`](../../../common/llm.ts).
